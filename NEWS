------------------------------
- sendfile() handles errors and non-optimal conditions The Right Way(tm).

- A meaningful error is now generated with bad group files.

- Complex group permissions work correctly now, where they did not in a
  rare case.

- Corrected minor log issues.

------------------------------

    All messages that get logged are now preceded with

    as seperate binaries.

    logins.
