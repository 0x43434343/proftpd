Module
 mod_auth 

Compatibility
 1.2.2 and later 

Description
Normally, a 530 response message is sent to an FTP client immediately after 
a failed authentication attempt, with a standard message indicating the the
reason of failure.  In the case of a wrong password, the reason is usually
"Login incorrect."  It is this message can be customized with the AccessDenyMsg
directive. In the message argument, the magic cookie '%u' is replaced with
the username specified by the client during login.

Description
Normally, a 230 response message is sent to an FTP client immediately after 
authentication, with a standard message indicating that the user has either 
logged in or that anonymous access has been granted. This message 
can be customized with the AccessGrantMsg directive. In the message argument, 
the magic cookie '%u' is replaced with the username specified by the client 
during login.

Access control directive

Allow
  [from] all|none|host|network[,host|network[,...]]


Default
 Allow from all 

Context
 Limit 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0pl6 and later 

Description
The Allow directive is used inside a Limit context to explicitly
specify which hosts and/or networks have access to the commands or
operations being limited. Allow is typically used in conjunction
with Order and Deny in order to create sophisticated (or perhaps
not-so-sophisticated) access control rules. Allow takes an optional
first argument; the keyword from. Using from is purely cosmetic. The
remaining arguments are expected to be a list of hosts and networks which
will be explicitly granted access. The magic keyword all can be used to
indicate that all hosts will explicitly be granted access (analogous to
the AllowAll directive, except with a lower priority). Additionally, the
magic keyword none can be used to indicate that no hosts or networks
will be explicitly granted access (although this does not prevent
them from implicitly being granted access). If all or none is used,
no other hosts or networks can be supplied.  Host and network addresses
can be specified by name or numeric address. For security reasons, it is
recommended that all address information be supplied numerically. Relying
solely on named addresses causes security to depend a great deal upon
DNS servers which may themselves be vulnerable to attack or spoofing.
Numeric addresses which specify an entire network should end in a
trailing period (i.e. 10.0.0. for the entire 10.0.0 subnet). Named
address which specify an entire network should begin with a trailing
period (i.e. .proftpd.net for the entire proftpd.net domain).

Default
 Default is to implicitly AllowAll, but not explicitly 

Context
 Directory, Anonymous, Limit, .ftpaccess 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
The AllowAll directive explicitly allows access to a Directory,
Anonymous or Limit block. Although proftpd's default
behavior is to allow access to a particular object, the default is
an implicit allow. AllowAll creates an explicit allow, overriding any
higher level denial directives.

AllowFilter
  regular-expression


Default
 None 

Context
 server config, VirtualHost, Anonymous, Global 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 1.2.0pre7 and later 

Description

AllowFilter allows the configuration of a regular expression
that must be matched for all command arguments sent to ProFTPD. It is
extremely useful in controlling what characters may be sent in a
command to ProFTPD, preventing some possible types of attacks against
ProFTPD. The regular expression is applied against the arguments to
the command sent by the client, so care must be taken when creating a
proper regex.  Commands that fail the regex match result in a
"Forbidden command" error being returned to the client.  If the
regular-expression argument contains whitespace, it must be enclosed
in quotes.

AllowForeignAddress
  on|off


Default
 AllowForeignAddress off 

Context
 server config, VirtualHost, Anonymous, Global 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 1.1.7 and later 

Description
Normally, proftpd disallows clients from using the ftp PORT command with
anything other than their own address (the source address of the ftp
control connection), as well as preventing the use of PORT to specify
a low-numbered ( 1024) port. In either case, the client is sent an
Invalid port error and a message is syslog'd indicating either
address mismatch or bounce attack. By enabling
this directive, proftpd will allow clients to transmit foreign data
connection addresses that do not match the client's address. This allows
such tricks as permitting a client to transfer a file between two FTP
servers without involving itself in the actual data connection. Generally
it's considered a bad idea, security-wise, to permit this sort of thing.
AllowForeignAddress only affects data connection addresses; not tcp
ports. There is no way (and no valid reason) to allow a client to use
a low-numbered port in its PORT command.

Context
 Limit 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 1.1.1 and later 

Description
AllowGroup specifies a group-expression that is specifically
permitted within the context of the Limit block it is applied
to. group-expression has the same format as that used in DefaultRoot, in
that it should contain a comma separated list of groups or not
groups (by prefixing a group name with the `!' character) that are to
be allowed access to the block. The expression is parsed as a boolean
and list, meaning that ALL elements of the expression must
evaluate to logically true in order for the explicit allow to apply.

  on|off


Default
 AllowLogSymlinks off 

Context
 server config, VirtualHost, Global 

Module
 mod_log 

Compatibility
 1.2.2rc2 and later 

Description
By default, the server will the path of any configured SystemLog, any configured
TransferLogs, and any configured ExtendedLogs to see if they are symbolic
links.  If the paths are symbolic links, the server will refuse to log to that
link unless explicitly configured to do so via this directive.

Security note:
Security note: this behaviour should not be allowed unless for
a very good reason.  By allowing the server to open symbolic links with
its root privileges, you are allowing a potential symlink attack where
the server could be tricked into overwriting arbitrary system files.
You have been warned.

Context

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 1.2.7rc1 and later 

Description
Normally, the server will look for and parse any files in the encountered
directories called ".ftpaccess".  The files provide a functionality
similar to Apache's .htaccess files -- mini-configuration files.  This
directive controls when those .ftpaccess files will be parsed.

The optional parameters are used to restrict the use of .ftpaccess files only
to specific users.  If the "user" restriction is given, then expression is a
user-expression specifying to which users the rule applies.  Similarly for the
"group" restriction.  For the "class" restriction, the expression is simply
the name of connection class for whom the rule will apply.

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
The AllowRetrieveRestart directive permits or denies clients from
performing restart retrieve file transfers via the FTP
REST command. By default this is enabled, so that clients may resume
interrupted file transfers at a later time without losing previously
collected data.

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
The AllowStoreRestart directive permits or denies clients from
restarting interrupted store file transfers (those sent
from client to server). By default restarting (via the REST command) is
not permitted when sending files to the server. Care should be taken to
disallow anonymous ftp incoming transfers to be restarted,
as this will allow clients to corrupt or increase the size of previously
stored files (even if not their own).

The REST (Restart STOR) command is automatically blocked when HiddenStor is
enabled, with the server returning a 501 error code to the client.

Description
AllowUser specifies a user-expression that is specifically 
permitted access within the context of the Limit 
block it is applied to. user-expression has a similar 
syntax as that used in AllowGroup, in that it should 
contain a comma delimited list of users or not users (by prefixing 
a user name with the `!' character) that are to be allowed access to the block. 
The expression is parsed as a boolean and list, meaning that ALL 
elements of the expression must evaluate to logically true in order to the explicit 
allow to apply.

Context
 Anonymous 

Module
 mod_auth 

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
Normally, anonymous FTP logins do not require the client to authenticate themselves 
via the normal method of a transmitted cleartext password which is hashed and 
matched against an existing system user's password. Instead, anonymous logins 
are expected to enter their e-mail address when prompted for a password. Enabling 
the AnonRequirePassword directive requires anonymous logins to enter a valid 
password which must match the password of the user that the anonymous daemon 
runs as.  However using AuthUsingAlias
authentication can be matched against the password of the login username.
This can be used to create guest accounts, which function
exactly as normal anonymous logins do (and thus present a
chrooted 
protected file system to the client), but require a valid password on the server's 
host system.

Anonymous
  root-directory


Default
 None 

Context
 server config,VirtualHost, Global 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
The Anonymous configuration block is used to create an anonymous FTP
login, and is terminated by a matching /Anonymous directive. The
root-directory parameters specifies which directory the daemon will
first chdir to, and then chroot, immediately after login. Once the chroot
operation successfully completes, higher level directories are no longer
accessible to the running child daemon (and thus the logged in user). By
default, proftpd assumes an anonymous login if the remote client attempts
to login as the currently running user; unless the current user is root,
in which case anonymous logins are not allowed regardless of the presence
of an Anonymous block. To force anonymous logins to be bound to
a user other than the current user, see the User and Group directives. In
addition, if a User or Group directive is present in an Anonymous
block, the daemon permanently switches to the specified uid/gid before
chroot()ing.  Normally, anonymous logins are not required to authenticate
with a password, but are expected to enter a valid e-mail address in place
of a normal password (which is logged). If this behavior is undesirable
for a given Anonymous configuration block, it can be overridden
via the AnonRequirePassword directive.

Note: Chroot()ed anonymous directories do not need to have supplemental
system files in them, nor do they need to have any sort of specific
directory structure. This is because proftpd is designed to acquire as
much system information as possible before the chroot, and to leave open
those files which are needed for normal operation and reside outside
the new root directory.

Default
 None 

Context
 server config, VirtualHost, Global 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 1.1.3 and later 

Description
The AnonymousGroup directive specifies a group-expression to which all
matching users will be considered anonymous logins. The group-expression
argument is a boolean logically ANDed list of groups to which the user
must be a member of (or non-member if the group name is prefixed with
a `!' character). For more information on group-expressions see the
DefaultRoot directive.  If the authenticating user is matched by an
AnonymousGroup directive, no valid password is required, and a special
dynamic anonymous configuration is created, with the user's home directory
as the default root directory. If a DefaultRoot directive also applies
to the user, this directory is used instead of the user's home dir.
Great care should be taken when using AnonymousGroup, as improper
configuration can open up user home directories to full read/write access
to the entire world.

 mod_auth 

Compatibility
 1.1.3 and later 

Description
AuthAliasOnly restricts authentication to aliased logins only;
i.e. those usernames provided by clients which are mapped
to a real userid by the UserAlias directive. Turning AuthAliasOnly `on'
in a particular context will cause proftpd to completely ignore all
non-aliased logins for the entire context. If no contexts are available
without AuthAliasOnly set to `on', proftpd rejects the client login and
sends an appropriate message to syslog.

 1.0.3/1.1.1 and later 

Description
AuthGroupFile specifies an alternate groups file, having the same
format as the system /etc/group file, and if specified is used
during authentication and group lookups for directory/access control
operations. The path argument should be the full path to the specified
file. AuthGroupFile can be configured on a per-VirtualHost basis, so
that virtual FTP servers can each have their own authentication database
(most often used in conjunction with AuthUserFile).

Note that this file need not reside inside a chroot()ed directory
structure for Anonymous or DefaultRoot logins, as it is held open for
the duration of client connections.

 1.2.0pre3 and later 

Description
This directive allows you to control whether or not PAM is the ultimate
authority on authentication. Setting this directive to on will cause
authentication to fail if PAM authentication fails. The default setting,
off, allows other modules and directives such as AuthUserFile and friends
to authenticate users, should PAM authentication fail. If you are having
problems with PAM and using other directives like AuthUserFile, set this
directive to off.

This allows a user to cd into any directory directly under /home/public or /var/devel, 
provided they have the appropriate rights. So, if /home/public/proftpd exists, 
cd proftpd will bring the user to that directory, regardless of where 
they currently are in the directory tree.

Context

Module

Compatibility
 0.99.0pl7 and later 

Description
The DefaultRoot directive controls the default root directory assigned
to a user upon login. If DefaultRoot is set to a directory other than
/, a chroot operation is performed immediately after a client
authenticates. This can be used to effectively isolate the client from
a portion of the host system filespace. The specified root directory
must begin with a / or can be the magic character '~'; meaning that the
client is chroot jailed into their home directory.

When the specified chroot directory is a symlink this will be resolved
to it's parent first before setting up the chroot.  This can have
unwanted side effects.  For example if a chroot is to be configured
within space to which a user as shell access, the chroot directory
could be converted to a symlink pointing at '/'.  Thus the chroot
would be to the root directory of the server.

If the DefaultRoot directive specifies a directory which disallows
access to the logged-in user's home directory, the user's current
working directory after login is set to the DefaultRoot instead of their
normal home directory. DefaultRoot cannot be used in Anonymous
configuration blocks, as the Anonymous directive explicitly
contains a root directory used for Anonymous logins.  The special
character '~' is replaced with the authenticating user's home directory
immediately after login. Note that the default root may be a subdirectory
of the home directory, such as ~/anon-ftp.

The optional group-expression argument can be used to restrict the
DefaultRoot directive to a unix group, groups or subset of groups. The
expression takes the format: [!]group-name1[,[!]group-name2[,...]]. The
expression is parsed in a logical boolean AND fashion, such that each
member of the expression must evaluate to logically TRUE in order for
the DefaultRoot directive to apply. The special character '!' is used
to negate group membership.

Care should be taken when using DefaultRoot. Chroot jails
should not be used as methods for implementing general system security
as there are potentially ways that a user can escape the jail.

Examples
Example of a DefaultRoot configuration:
ServerName A test ProFTPD Server
ServerType inetd
User ftp
Group ftp
#
# This causes proftpd to perform a chroot into the authenticating user's directory 
immediately after login.
# Once this happens, the user is unable to see higher level directories.
# Because a group-expression is included, only users who are a member of
# the group 'users' and NOT a member of 'staff' will have their default
# root directory set to '~'.
DefaultRoot ~ users,!staff

Description
The DefaultServer directive controls which server configuration is used as 
the default when an incoming connection is destined for an IP address which 
is neither the host's primary IP address or one of the addresses specified in 
a VirtualHost configuration block. Normally such 
unknown connections are issued a no server available to service 
your request message and disconnected. When DefaultServer is turned on 
for either the primary server configuration or a virtual server, all unknown 
destination connections are serviced by the default server. Only a single server 
configuration can be set to default.

Description
The DeferWelcome directive configures a master or 
virtual server to delay transmitting the 
ServerName and address to new connections, 
until a client has successfully authenticated. If enabled, the initial welcome 
message will be exceedingly generic and will not give away any type of information 
about the host that the daemon is actively running on. This can be used by security-conscious 
administrators to limit the amount of probing possible from non-trusted 
networks/hosts.

Description
The DenyAll directive is analogous to a combination of order
deny,allow cr deny from all, with the exception that it
has a higher precedence when parsed. It is provided as a convenient
method of completely denying access to a directory, anonymous ftp or
limit block. Because of its precedence, it should not be intermixed with
normal  Order/Deny directives. The DenyAll directive can be overridden
at a lower level directory by using AllowAll. DenyAll and AllowAll are
mutually exclusive.

has the same format as that used in DefaultRoot, 
in that it should contain a comma separated list of groups or not 
groups (by prefixing a group name with the `!' character) that are to be denied 
access to the block. The expression is parsed as a boolean and list, 
meaning that ALL elements of the expression must evaluate to logically true

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
This directive creates a block of configuration directives which applies only 
to the specified directory and its sub-directories. The block is ended with 
/Directory. Per-directory configuration is enabled during run-time with 
a closest match algorithm, meaning that the Directory directive 
with the closest matching path to the actual pathname of the file or directory 
in question is used. Per-directory configuration is inherited by all sub-directories 
until a closer matching Directory is encountered, at which time the 
original per-directory configuration is replaced with the closer match. Note 
that this does not apply to Limit /Limit blocks, which are 
inherited by all sub-directories until a Limit block is reached in a 
closer match.


A trailing slash and wildcard (/*) can be appended to the
directory, specifying that the configuration block applies only to the contents
(and sub-contents), not to the actual directory itself. Such wildcard matches
always take precedence over non-wildcard Directory configuration
blocks. Directory blocks cannot be nested (they are automatically
nested at run-time based on their pathnames). Pathnames must always be absolute
(except inside Anonymous), and should not reference symbolic links.
Pathnames inside an Anonymous block can be relative, indicating that
they are based on the anonymous root directory.

[Notes for ProFTPD 1.1.3 and later only]
Pathnames that begin with the special character '~' and do not specify 
a username immediately after ~ are put into a special deferred mode. 
When in deferred mode, the directory context is not hashed and sorted into the 
configuration tree at boot time, but rather this hashing is deferred until a 
user authenticates, at which time the '~' character is replaced with the user's 
home directory. This allows a global Directory block which applies to 
all user's home directories, or sub-directories thereof.

login. The filename can be either relative or absolute. In the case of a
relative filename, the file is searched for starting in the home directory
of the user the server is running as. As this can lead confusion, absolute
pathnames are suggested. If the file cannot be found or accessed, no
error occurs and nothing is logged or displayed to the client.

Description
The DisplayFirstChdir directive configures an ASCII text filename which will
be displayed to the user the first time they change into a directory (via
CWD)  per a given session. The file will also be displayed if proftpd detects
that its last modification time has changed since the previous CWD into a
given directory. If the filename is relative, it is looked for in the new
directory that the user has changed into. Note that for anonymous ftp logins
(see Anonymous), the file must reside inside the chroot()ed file
system space. If the file cannot be found or accessed, no error occurs and
nothing is logged or displayed to the client.
DisplayFirstChdir, DisplayConnect, DisplayLogin and DisplayQuit support the
following magic cookies (only in 0.99.0pl10 and later), which are
replaced with their respective strings before being displayed to the user.
%T	Current Time

%F	Available space on file system

%C	Current working directory

%R	Remote host name

%L	Local host name

%u	Username reported by ident protocol

%U	Username originally used in login

%M	Max number of connections

%N	Current number of connections

%E	Server admin's e-mail address

 
%x	The name of the user's class

%y	Current number of connections from the user's class

%z	Max number of connections from the user's class
NOTE: not all of these may have a rational value, depending on the context in
which they're used (e.g., %u if ident lookups are off).

directory for unix user logins, anonymous-root directory for anonymous logins). Note: that for jailed
logins, the file must reside inside the chroot()ed file system space. If

Description
The ExtendedLog directive allows customizable logfiles to be generated, either 
globally or per VirtualHost. The filename 
argument must contain an absolute pathname to a logfile which will be appended 
to when proftpd starts; the pathname should not be to a file in a nonexistent
directory, to a world-writeable directory, or be a symbolic link (unless
AllowLogSymlinks is set to on).  Multiple logfiles (potentially with different
command classes and formats) can be created.  Optionally, the command-classes
argument can be used to control which types of commands are logged. If not
command classes are specified, proftpd logs all commands by default (passwords
are hidden).  command-classes is a comma delimited (no whitespace!) list of
which commands to log.

The following are valid classes:
NONE
No commands
AUTH
Authentication commands (USER, PASS)
INFO
Informational commands (PWD, SYST, etc)
DIRS
Directory commands (LIST, CWD, MKD, etc)
READ
File reading (RETR)
WRITE
File/directory writing or creation
MISC
Miscellaneous commands (SITE, etc)
ALL
All commands (default)

If a format-nickname argument is supplied, ExtendedLog 
will use the predefined logformat (created by LogFormat). 
Otherwise, the default format of %h %l %u %t \%r\ %s %b 
is used.

The group ID of groupname cannot be 0.
Note that GroupOwner cannot be used to override the host OS/file system user/group 
paradigm. If the current user is not a member of the specified group, new files 
and directories will not be able to be chown()ed to the GroupOwner group. If 
this happens, file STOR (send file from client to server) and MKD/XMKD (mkdir) operations 
will succeed normally, however the new directory entries will be owned by the 
current user's default group (a warning message is also logged) instead of by 
the desired group.  If you also use UserOwner
in the same context, this restriction is lifted.

Compatibility
 1.2.0pre5 and later 

Description
The HiddenStor directive enables two-step file uploads: files are uploaded 
as .in.filename. and once the upload is complete, 
renamed to just filename. This provides a 
degree of atomicity and helps prevent 1) incomplete uploads and 2) files being 
used while they're still in the progress of being uploaded. Note: 
if the temporary file name is already in use (e.g., a server crash during upload), 
it will prevent the file from being uploaded.

The REST (Restart STOR) command is automatically blocked when HiddenStor is
enabled, with the server returning a 501 error code to the client.

Default
 None 

Context
 Directory, .ftpaccess 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 1.2.7rc1 and later 

Description
The HideFiles directive configures a Directory section to hide all
directory entries, e.g. its files and sub-directories, that match the given
regular expression. These files can still be operated on by other FTP commands
(DELE, RETR, etc), as constrained by any applicable Limits, but this
can be modified using the IgnoreHidden directive.  Note that this directive
manipulates a file's "hidden-ness", but doesn't do any hiding by itself.  A
Limit section, with IgnoreHidden enabled, does the actual hiding of the
files from the Limited commands.

As Directory configurations are inherited by sub-directories, the "none"
parameter can be used to disable any inherited file hiding within a
sub-directory, usually through the use of a .ftpaccess file.

The optional parameters are used to restrict the rule for hiding files only
to specific users.  If "user" restriction is given, then expression is a
user-expression specifying to which users the rule applies.  Similarly for the
"group" restriction.  For the "class" restriction, the expression is simply
the name of connection class for whom the rule will apply.

An unrestricted HideFiles directive and an unrestriected ShowFiles directive
cannot be used simultaneously in the context.

Example:

  # Hide configuration and passwd files from view
  HideFiles "(\\.conf|passwd)$"

  # ...or the same regex, without the quotes
  HideFiles (\.conf|passwd)$

  # Hide those same files from everyone _except_ a special user
  HideFiles (\.conf|passwd)$ user !tj

  # Using the ! prefix to "invert" the regular expression matching,
  # allow only .txt and .html files to be seen
  HideFiles !(\.txt|\.html)$

  # Only let users of the webmaster group see HTML files, but nothing else
  HideFiles !(\.htm|\.html)$ group webmaster

The HideGroup directive configures a

group of the currently logged-in, authenticated user . Normally, hidden 
directories and files cannot be seen via LIST or NLST commands but can 
be operated on via other FTP commands (CWD, DELE, RETR, etc). This behavior 
can be modified via the IgnoreHidden directive.

Description

The HideNoAccess directive configures a Directory or
Anonymous block to hide all directory entries in a directory
listing (via the LIST or NLST FTP commands) to which the current
logged-in, authenticated user has no access. Normal Unix-style
permissions always apply, so that although a user may not be able to
see a directory entry that has HideNoAccess applied, they will receive
a normal Permission denied error message when attempting
to blindly manipulate the file system object. The directory or file
can be made completely invisible to all FTP commands by applying
IgnoreHidden in conjunction with HideNoAccess.

The IfDefine test.../IfDefine section is used to mark

everything between the start and end markers is ignored.

The test in the IfDefine section directive can be one of two
forms: 'parameter-name' or '!parameter-name'

In the former case, the directives between the start and end markers are
only processed if the parameter named parameter-name is defined. The
second format reverses the test, and only processes the directives if
parameter-name is not defined. 

The parameter-name argument is a define as given on the command line
via -Dparameter-name, at the time the server was started.

 
IfDefine sections are nest-able, which can be used to implement
simple multiple-parameter tests.

everything between the start and end markers is ignored.

The test in the IfModule section directive can be one of two
forms: "module name" or "!module name"

In the former case, the directives between the start and end markers
are only processed if the module named module name is compiled in to
ProFTPD. The second format reverses the test, and only processes the
directives if module name is not compiled in.

The module name argument is a module name as given as the file name of
the module, at the time it was compiled. For example, mod_sql.c.

IfModule sections are nest-able, which can be used to implement
simple multiple-module tests.

Compatibility

Description
Normally, files hidden via HideNoAccess, HideUser or HideGroup
can be operated on by all FTP commands (assuming Unix file
permissions allow access), even though they do not appear in directory
listings. Additionally, even when normal file system permissions disallow
access, proftpd returns a Permission denied error to the
client, indicating that the requested object does exist, even if it
cannot be acted upon. IgnoreHidden configures a Limit block to
completely ignore any hidden directory entries for the set of limited FTP
commands. This has the effect of returning an error similar to No
such file or directory when the client attempts to use the limited
command upon a hidden directory or file.

			Description

		LDAPHomedirOnDemand activates on-demand home directory creation.
		If a user logs in and does not yet have a home directory, a home
		directory is created automatically.

		In mod_ldap &#60;= 2.7.6, the home directory will be owned by the
		same user and group that ProFTPD runs as (see the User and Group
		configuration directives). mod_ldap &#62;= 2.8 can create home
		directories for users with any UID/GID, not just those with the same
		UID/GID as the main ProFTPD server.

		The second argument allows you to specify the mode (default
		permissions) to use when creating home directories on demand,
		subject to ProFTPD's umask (see the Umask directive). If no
		directory mode is specified, the default of 0755 is used. Directory
		mode setting is only supported in mod_ldap v2.7 or later.

			Description

		LDAPHomedirOnDemandPrefix enables a prefix to be specified for
		on-demand home directory creation. This is most useful if mod_ldap
		is being used to authenticate against an LDAP directory that does
		not return a homeDirectory attribute, either because it cannot
		(Microsoft Active Directory, for example) or because you do not wish
		to extend your existing directory schema.

		For example, setting this directive to "/home" and logging in
		as the user "joe" would result in his home directory being created
		as "/home/joe". The directory will be created with the mode
		specified in LDAPHomedirOnDemand.  To use
		this directive, LDAPHomedirOnDemand must be
		enabled.

			Description

		LDAPNegativeCache specifies whether or not to cache negative
		responses from the LDAP server when using LDAP for UID/GID lookups.
		This option is useful if you also use/are in transition from another
		authentication system; if there are many users in your old
		authentication system that aren't in the LDAP database, there can be
		a significant delay when a directory listing is performed as the
		UIDs not in the LDAP database are repeatedly looked up in an attempt
		to present usernames instead of UIDs in directory listings. With
		LDAPNegativeCache set to on, negative ("not found") responses from
		the LDAP server will be cached and speed will improve on directory
		listings that contain many users not present in the LDAP
		database.

Module

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
The Limit configuration block is used to place access restrictions on one or 
more FTP commands, within a given context. Limits flow downward, so that a Limit 
configuration in the server config context applies to all Directory 
and Anonymous blocks that also 
reside in the configuration; until it is overridden by a lower Limit 
block. Any number of command parameters can be specified, 
against which the contents of the Limit block will be applied. command 
can be any valid FTP command, but is generally one of the following:
CWD (Change Working Directory)
Sent by client when changing directories.
MKD / XMKD (MaKe Directory)
Sent by client to create a new directory.
RNFR (ReName FRom), RNTO (ReName TO)
Sent as a pair by client to rename a directory entry.
DELE (DELEte)
Sent by client to delete a file.
RMD / XRMD (ReMove Directory)
Sent by client to remove a directory.
RETR (RETRieve)
Transfer a file from the server to the client.
STOR (STORe)
Transfer a file from the client to the server.
In addition, the following command-groups are accepted. 
They have a lower precedence than real commands, meaning that a real command 
limit will always be applied instead of the command-group.
READ
All FTP commands which deal with file reading (directory listing not included): 
  RETR, SITE, SIZE, STAT
WRITE
All FTP commands which deal with file or directory write/creation/deletion:
  APPE, DELE, MKD, RMD, RNTO, STOR, XMKD, XRMD
DIRS
All FTP commands which deal with directory listing:
  CDUP, CWD, LIST, MDTM, NLST, PWD, RNFR, XCUP, XCWD, XPWD
ALL
ALL FTP commands (identical to READ WRITE DIRS).  Note this group has the
lowest precedence of all; it will not override a limit imposed by another
command-group (e.g. DIRS).
Finally, a special command is allowed which can be used to control login access:
LOGIN
Connection or login to the server. Applying a Limit to this pseudo-command 
can be used to allow or deny initial connection or login to the context. It 
has no effect, and is ignored, when used in a context other than server config, 
VirtualHost or Anonymous 
(i.e. using it in a Directory context is 
meaningless).
Limit command restrictions should not be confused with file/directory 
access permission. While limits can be used to restrict a command on a certain 
directory, they cannot be used to override the file permissions inherent to 
the base operating/file system.
The following FTP commands cannot be restricted via Limit:
  ABOR
  HELP
  MODE (not implemented, always S)
  NOOP
  PASS (use Limit LOGIN)
  PASV
  PORT
  QUIT
  REST (use AllowRetrieveRestart, AllowStoreRestart)
  STRU (not implemented, always F)
  SYST
  TYPE
  USER (use Limit LOGIN)

The special value none may be supplied which removes 
all maximum connection limits from the applicable configuration context. Additionally, 
an optional message argument may be used which will 
be displayed to a client attempting to exceed the maximum value; immediately 
before disconnection. The message argument is parsed 
for the magic string %m, which is replaced with 
the configured maximum value. If message is not 
supplied, a system-wide default message is used.
Example:

Description
The MaxInstances directive configures the maximum number of child processes 
that may be spawned by a parent proftpd process in standalone 
mode. The directive has no effect when used on a server running in inetd 
mode.
Because each child proftpd process represents a single client connection, 
this directive also controls the maximum number of simultaneous connections 
allowed. Additional connections beyond the configured limit are syslog'd and 
silently disconnected. The MaxInstances directive can be used to prevent undesirable 
denial-of-service attacks (repeatedly connecting to the ftp port, causing 
proftpd to fork-bomb). By default, no limit is placed on the number of child 
processes that may run at one time.

Compatibility
 1.2.7rc1 and later 

Description
When downloading files to clients (eg serving a RETR request), the
server will check for any configured limit against the size of the file
being requested, and abort any transfers if the requested file's size
exceeds the configured limit.

A single "*" argument configures unlimited file sizes, and is used
primarily to override any inherited restrictions from higher contexts.
The given number is the number of bytes for the limit, and is followed
by a units specifier of (case-insensitive) "Gb" (Gigabytes),
"Mb" (Megabytes), "Kb" (Kilobytes), or "B" (bytes).  The given number of
bytes is multiplied by the appropriate factor.

 
The optional parameters are used to restrict the file size limits only
to specific users.  If the "user" restriction is given, then expression is a
user-expression specifying to which users the rule applies.  Similarly for the
"group" restriction.  For the "class" restriction, the expression is simply
the name of connection class for whom the rule will apply.  If no matching
user, group, or class expression is found for the current user (in that
order), then a limit with no expression (i.e. no "user", "group", or "class"
identifier) is applied.

Description
By default, proftpd sends multiline responses as per RFC 959, i.e.:

RFC 2228 specifies that "6xy" 
response codes will be sent as follows: 
600-First line
600-More lines...
600 Last line
Note that 2228 ONLY specifies this for response codes starting with 
'6'. Enabling this directive causes ALL responses to be sent in this 
format, which may be more compatible with certain web browsers and clients. 
Also note that this is NOT the same as wu-ftpd's multiline responses, 
which do not comply with any RFC. Using this method of multilines is more likely 
to be compatible with all clients, although it isn't strictly RFC, and is thus 
not enabled by default.

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0pl6 and later 

Description
The Order directive configures the order in which Allow and Deny directives are checked inside of a Limit block. Because Allow directives are permissive, and Deny directives restrictive, the order in which they are examined can significantly alter the way security functions.  If the default setting of allow,deny is used, allowed access permissions are checked first. If an Allow directive explicitly allows access to the Limit context, access is granted and any Deny directives are never checked. If Allow did not explicitly permit access, Deny directives are checked. If any Deny directive applies, access is explicitly denied. Otherwise, access is granted.  When deny,allow is used, deny access 
restrictions are checked first. If any restriction applies, access is denied 
immediately. If nothing is denied, Allow permissions 
are checked. If an Allow explicitly permits access, access 
to the entire context is permitted; otherwise access is implicitly denied.
For clarification, the following illustrates the steps used when checking 
Allow/Deny access:
Order allow,deny
Check Allow directives. If one or more apply, exit with result: ALLOW
Check Deny directives. If one or more apply, exit with result: DENY
Exit with default implicit ALLOW
Order deny,allow
Check Deny directives. If one or more apply, exit with result: DENY
Check Allow directives. If one or more apply, exit with result: ALLOW
Exit with default implicit: DENY

Description

PassivePorts restricts the range of ports from which the server

randomly choose a number from within the specified range until an open
port is found.  Should no open ports be found within the given range,
the server will default to a normal kernel-assigned port, and a
message logged.

The port range selected must be in the non-privileged range
(eg. greater than or equal to 1024); it is STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED that the chosen range be large enough to handle many
simultaneous passive connections (for example, 49152-65534, the
IANA-registered ephemeral port range).

(note that /etc/shadow is never held open, for security reasons). On some 
platforms, you must turn this option on, as the libc functions are incapable 
of accessing these databases from inside of a chroot(). At configure-time, 
the configuration script will attempt to detect whether or not you need this 
support, and make it the default. However, such guessing may fail, 
and you will have to manually enable or disable the feature. If you cannot 
see user or group names when performing a directory listing inside an anonymous 
chrooted login, this indicates you must enable the directive. Use of the AuthUserFile 
or 
AuthGroupFile directives will force partial support 
for persistent user or group database files; regardless of PersistentPasswd's 
setting.

Note: NIS or NIS+ users will most likely want to disable this feature,
regardless of proftpd's detected configuration defaults. Failure to disable
this will make your NIS/NIS+ maps not work! On certain systems, you may also
need to compile ProFTPD with the --enable-autoshadow option in order to
authenticate both users from NIS maps and local users.

Description
The PidFile directive sets the file to which the server records
the process id of the daemon. The filename should be relative to the
system root, ie /var/run/proftpd/pidfile. The PidFile is only used
in standalone mode.
It is often useful to be able to send the server a signal, so
that it closes and then reopens its ErrorLog and TransferLog, and
re-reads its configuration files. This is done by sending a SIGHUP
(kill -1) signal to the process id of the master daemon listed in
the PidFile.

Description
The Port directive configures the TCP port which proftpd will listen on while 
running in standalone mode. It has no effect when used upon a server running in
inetd mode (see ServerType).  The directive can be used in conjunction with
VirtualHost in order to run a virtual server on the same IP address
as the master server, but listening on a different port.

For any server, either VirtualHost or server config, setting
Port 0 effectively turns off that server.

that this path must not be to a world-writeable directory and, unless
AllowLogSymlinks is explicitly set to on (generally a bad idea), the
path must not be a symbolic link.

If file is "none", no logging will be done at all; this setting can be

Compatibility
 1.2.7rc1 and later 

Description
The RadiusUserInfo directive is used to configure login information used for every user authenticated via RADIUS. The optional suppl-group-names and suppl-group-ids parameters are used to specify supplemental group membership for each user; the number of names and IDs must match if these parameters are used.

In order to support RADIUS servers that may use custom attributes in their Access-Accept response packets to supply user information back to the RADIUS client (mod_radius in this case), this directive allows the following syntax for some of its parameters:

  $(attribute-id:default-value)

where the enclosing $() signals that the parameter is to be supplied by
the RADIUS server, attribute-id is the custom attribute ID for which to
search in the response packet, and default-value is the value to use in
case the requested attribute is not present in the response packet. This
syntax is not supported for the suppl-group-names or suppl-group-ids
parameters.

If RadiusUserInfo is not used, mod_radius will perform pure "yes/no"
authentication only, in the style of PAM. The information that would
have been configured via this directive will be pulled from other sources
(e.g. /etc/passwd, AuthUserFiles, MySQL tables, etc).

root user may authenticate just as any other user could (assuming no other 
access control measures deny access); however the root login security message 
is still sysloged. Obviously, extreme 
care should be taken when using this directive.

The use of RootLogin in the Anonymous context is only valid when the User / Group defined in the Anonymous block is set to 'root'

Description
This directive deprecates 'SQLEmptyPasswords',

'SQLPlaintextPasswords', and 'SQLEncryptedPasswords'.

Specifies the allowed authentication types and their check order.  YOU
MUST SPECIFY AT LEAST ONE AUTHENTICATION METHOD.  

For example:

SQLAuthTypes Crypt Empty

means check whether the password in the database matches in UNIX
crypt() format; if that fails, check to see if the password in the
database is empty (matching ANY given password); if that fails,
mod_sql refuses to authenticate the user.

Current Types

Plaintext: allows passwords in the database to be in plaintext

OpenSSL:   allows passwords in the database to be of the form
	   '{digestname}hashedvalue'.  This check is only available if
	   you define 'HAVE_OPENSSL' when you compile proftd and you
	   link with the OpenSSL 'crypto' library. 

Crypt:     allows passwords in the database to be in UNIX crypt() form

Backend:   a database-specific backend check function.  Not all
	   backends support this.  Specifically, the MySQL backend
	   uses this type to authenticate MySQL 'PASSWORD()' encrypted
	   passwords.  The Postgres backend does nothing.

Empty:     allows empty passwords in the database, which match against
	   ANYTHING the user types in.  The database field must be a
	   truly empty string -- that is, NULL values are never
	   accepted.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS AUTHTYPE.

  Description
    The SQLAuthenticate directive controls the behavior of mod_sql 
regarding the authentication process.  SQLAuthenticate can provide fine grained 
control over authentication of logins and file access for both users and groups. 
  Using this directive, mod_sql can be configured to be the authoritative 
authentication mechanism - in that case, mod_sql provides authentication and all
 other authentication mechanisms will be bypassed.
    The syntax for SQLAuthenticate can take one of two possible formats.  
The simplest syntax is a simple on | off format:

    
      on
                  mod_sql will perform login authentication and will also control 
file access using both user ID and group ID.  This is equivalent to the 
following alternative syntax:
                                          SQLAuthenticate users groups userset groupset
              
            
          
        
      
      off
                  mod_sql will not perform user or group lookups nor will it 
control file access or functionality.
          
        
      
    
    

    A more complex syntax is provided to provide finer control of the 
behavior of mod_sql.  Two features in particular may be controlled via this 
syntax:
                                  Authorititative lookups and authentication
        
        	                File access or functionality control based on UID or GID
        
      
      The following command options are used to control these features.  Note 
that each of these options may be listed in any order.
    

    
      users[*]
                  If this option is present, user lookups will take place.  
Appending an asterisk to users will cause 
mod_sql to become authoritiative for user lookups.  All other user 
authentication methods will be ignored.  If this option is not included, mod_sql
 will not perform any user lookups.
          
        
      
      groups[*]
                  If this option is present, group lookups will take place.  
Appending an asterisk to groups will cause 
mod_sql to become authoritiative for group lookups.  All other authentication 
methods will be ignored.  If this option is not included, mod_sql will not 
perform any group lookups.
          
        
      
      userset[fast]
                  If this option is present, mod_sql will control file access or 
functionality by processing the (get|set|end)pwent calls. These calls are used 
to determine file access rights based on username.  This option has no effect if
 the user[*] option is not present.
          If mod_sql is used to authenticate a significant number of 
users, the (set|get|end)pwent calls can become expensive.  The number of queries
 will be n+1, where n is the number of users to be looked up.  On a large 
system, this can significantly slow logins.  Using the 
usersetfast option will cause a single query
 to be performed to lookup all users, speeding up the login process.  The 
drawback to this option is that memory utilization will be increased. 
          
        
      
      groupset[fast]
                  If this option is present, mod_sql will control file access or 
functionality by processing the (get|set|end)grent calls. These calls are used 
to determine file access rights based on groupname.  This option has no effect 
if the group[*] option is not present.
          If mod_sql is used to authenticate a significant number of 
groups, the (set|get|end)grent calls can become expensive.  The number of 
queries will be n+1, where n is the number of groups to be looked up.  On a 
large system, this can significantly slow logins. Using the 
groupsetfast option will cause a single query 
to be performed to lookup all groups, speeding up the login process.  The 
drawback to this option is that memory utilization will be increased. 
          
        
      
    

    Turning off (not including) userset or groupset affects the 
functionality of mod_sql.  Not allowing these lookups may remove the ability to 
control access or control functionality by group membership, depending on your 
other auth handlers and the data available to them.  At the same time, choosing 
not to do these lookups may dramatically speed login for many large sites.
    
    The 'fast' suffix is not appropriate for every site.  Normally, 
mod_sql will retrieve a list of users and groups, and get information from the 
database on a per-user or per-group basis.  This is query intensive -- it 
requires (n+1) queries, where n is the number of users or groups to lookup.  By 
choosing 'fast' lookups, mod_sql will make a single SELECT query to get 
information from the database.
    
    In exchange for the radical reduction in the number of queries, the 
single query will increase the memory consumption of the process -- all group 
or user information will be read at once rather than in discrete chunks.
    

    Note:If the 
groupset option is specified, mod_sql requires 
that the SQL group table contain only a single record for each group.  All 
members of a group must be specified in the single record.  Make sure that the 
group table is created with a sufficent column size for group members - for 
example, a MySQL group table should use type 
TEXT for the group members column, providing 
65535 characters for listing all of the group members in a comma-separated list.

  Examples
    If user and group lookups are desired, but other means will be used to
 perform file access control, and the user/group lookups are not to be 
authoritatuve, the following directive syntax is appropriate.  This is not a 
particuarly interesting configuration.
                  SQLAuthenticate users groups
      
    

    A more interesting configuration for mod_sql is shown below.  In this 
configuration, mod_sql is authoritative for both users and groups, and also 
performs access control based on both user name and group membership.  Utilizing
 a configuration such as this removes the need to provide a shell account for 
users on the server, while still providing non-anonymous ftp access with 
access control. The fast option is also used to speed up logins, at the 
expense of increased memory utilization.

Context

Module

Compatibility
 1.2.0 and later 

Description
This directive deprecates 'MySQLInfo', 'PostgresInfo', and
'PostgresPort'.

Specifies connection information.  Connection-info specifies the
database, host, port, and other backend-specific information.
username and password specify the username and password to connect as,
respectively.  Both default to NULL, which the backend will treat in
some backend-specific manner. If you specify a password, you MUST
specify a username.

Any given backend has the opportunity (but not the responsibility) to
check for syntax errors in the connection-info field at proftpd
startup, but you shouldn't expect semantic errors (i.e., can't connect
to the database) to be caught until mod_sql attempts to connect for a
given host. 

The MySQL and Postgres backends connection-info is expected to be of
the form: 

database[@hostname][:port]

hostname will default to a backend-specific hostname (which happens to
be 'localhost' for both the MySQL and Postgres backends), and port
will default to a backend-specific default port (3306 for the MySQL
backend, 5432 for the Postgres backend).

Examples:

SQLConnectInfo  ftpusers@foo.com

means "Try connecting to the database 'ftpuser' via the default port
at 'foo.com'.  Use a NULL username and a NULL password."

SQLConnectInfo  ftpusers:3000 admin

means "Try connecting to the database 'ftpuser' via port 3000 at
'localhost'.  Use the username 'admin' and a NULL password."

SQLConnectInfo  ftpusers@foo.com:3000 admin mypassword

means "Try connecting to the database 'ftpuser' via port 3000 at
'foo.com'.  Use the username 'admin' and the password 'mypassword'"

Backends may require different information in the connection-info
field; check your backend module for specifics.

This directive causes mod_sql to pretend it has no group information.
It necessarily breaks ALL CONFIG FILES up to 1.2.0rc2, since mod_sql
now assumes that group information is available UNLESS this directive
is set to OFF.

This DOESN'T override SQLAuthoritative -- if SQLAuthoritative is set
to 'On' but SQLDoGroupAuth is set to 'Off', all group-related queries
will fail without giving other modules the opportunity to handle them.

Prior to 1.2.0, there was no way to provide group information from the
database.  This caused a few bugs, and reduced the functionality of
this module.

		SQLNegativeCache specifies whether or not to cache negative
		responses from SQL lookups when using SQL for UID/GID lookups.
		Depending on your SQL tables, there can be a significant delay
                when a directory listing is performed as the UIDs not in the
                SQL database are repeatedly looked up in an attempt to present
                usernames instead of UIDs in directory listings. With
                SQLNegativeCache set to on, negative ("not found") responses from
		SQL queries will be cached and speed will improve on directory
		listings that contain many users not present in the SQL
		database.

relevant punctuation, and *must not* contain a leading 'and'.

As an example of switching from the old-style 'SQLKey' and
'SQLKeyField' directives, if you had:

SQLKey           true
SQLKeyfield      LoginAllowed

You would now use:

SQLWhereClause   "LoginAllowed = 'true'"

This would be appended to every user-related query as the string 

" and (LoginAllowed = 'true')"

Description
Compatibility: 0.99.0pl6 and later
Symbolic links (if supported on the host OS and filesystem) can be either 
shown in directory listings (including the target of the link) or can be hidden 
(proftpd dereferences symlinks and reports the target's permissions and ownership). 
The default behavior is to show all symbolic links when normal users are logged 
in, and hide them for anonymous sessions. If a symbolic link cannot be dereferenced 
for any reason (permissions, target does not exist, etc) and ShowSymlinks 
is off, proftpd displays the link as a directory entry of type 'l' (link) 
with the ownership and permissions of the actual link.
Under ProFTPD versions 1.1.5 and higher, the default behavior in regard to 
ShowSymlinks has been changed so that symbolic links are always displayed 
as such (in all cases), unless ShowSymlinks off is explicitly set.

SocketBindTight
  SocketBindTight on|off


Default
 SocketBindTight off 

Context
 server config 

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0pl6 and later 

Description
The SocketBindTight directive controls how proftpd creates and binds its 
initial tcp listen sockets in standalone mode (see 
ServerType). The directive has no effect upon servers 
running in inetd mode, because listen sockets are 
not needed or created. When SocketBindTight is set to off 
(the default), a single listening socket is created for each port that the 
server must listen on, regardless of the number of IP addresses being used 
by VirtualHost configurations. This has 
the benefit of typically requiring a relatively small number of file descriptors 
for the master daemon process, even if a large number of virtual servers are 
configured. If SocketBindTight is set to on, a listen 
socket is created and bound to a specific IP address for the master server 
and all configured virtual servers. This allows for situations where an administrator 
may wish to have a particular port be used by both proftpd (on one IP address) 
and another daemon (on a different IP address). The drawback is that considerably 
more file descriptors will be required if a large number of virtual servers 
must be supported.
Example: Two servers have been configured (one master and one virtual), with 
the IP addresses 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2, respectively. The 10.0.0.1 server 
runs on port 21, while 10.0.0.2 runs on port 2001.
SocketBindTight off #default
# proftpd creates two sockets, both bound to ALL available addresses.
# one socket listens on port 21, the other on 2001. Because each socket is
# bound to all available addresses, no other daemon or user process will be
# allowed to bind to ports 21 or 2001.
...
SocketBindTight on
# proftpd creates two sockets again, however one is bound to 10.0.0.1, port 
21
# and the other to 10.0.0.2, port 2001. Because these sockets are tightly
# bound to IP addresses, port 21 can be reused on any address OTHER than
# 10.0.0.1, and visa-versa with 10.0.0.2, port 2001.
One side-effect of setting SocketBindTight to on 
is that connections to non-bound addresses will result in a connection 
refused message rather than the typical 500 Sorry, no server available 
to handle request on xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx., due to the fact that no listen 
socket has been bound to the particular address/port pair. This may or may 
not be aesthetically desirable, depending on your circumstances.

Compatibility
 1.1.6 and later 

Description
Proftpd logs its activity via the Unix syslog mechanism, which allows for 
several different general classifications of logging messages, known as "facilities." 
Normally, all authentication related messages are logged with the AUTHPRIV 
(or AUTH) facility [intended to be secure, and never seen by unwanted eyes], 
while normal operational messages are logged with the DAEMON facility. The 
SyslogFacility directive allows ALL logging messages to be directed to a different 
facility than the default. When this directive is used, ALL logging is done 
with the specified facility, both authentication (secure) and otherwise.
The facility-level argument must be one of the 
following: AUTH (or AUTHPRIV), CRON, 
DAEMON, KERN, LPR, MAIL, NEWS, USER, UUCP, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, 
LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6 or LOCAL7.

The filename argument should contain an absolute 
path, and should not be to a file in a nonexistent directory, in a
world-writeable directory, or be a symbolic link (unless AllowLogSymlinks
is set to on). Use of this directive overrides any facility set by the
SyslogFacility directive.  Additionally, the special keyword NONE can be used

Compatibility
 1.2.1 and later 

Description

TCPAccessFiles specifies two files, an allow and a deny file, each
of which contain the IP addresses, networks or name-based masks to be
allowed or denied connections to the server. The files have the same
format as the standard tcpwrappers hosts.allow/deny files.

Both file names are required. Also, the paths to both files must
be the full path, with two exceptions: if the path starts with ~/, the
check of that path will be delayed until a user requests a connection,
at which time the path will be resolved to that user's home directory;
or if the path starts with ~user/, where user is some system user. In
this latter case, mod_wrap will attempt to resolve and verify the given
user's home directory on start-up.

The service name for which mod_wrap will look in the indicated
access files is proftpd by default; this can be configured via the
TCPServiceName directive.  There is a built-in precedence to the
TCPAccessFiles, TCPGroupAccessFiles, and TCPUserAccessFiles directives,
if all are used. mod_wrap will look for applicable TCPUserAccessFiles
for the connecting user first. If no applicable TCPUserAccessFiles is
found, mod_wrap will search for TCPGroupAccessFiles which pertain to
the connecting user.  If not found, mod_wrap will then look for the
server-wide TCPAccessFiles directive. This allows for access control to
be set on a per-server basis, and allow for per-user or per-group access
control to be handled without interfering with the server access rules.

The allow-level parameter sets the syslog level at which allowed connections
are logged; the deny-level parameter sets the syslog level for denied
connections.

a user-expression does not make much sense; however, this type of AND
evaluation allows for expressions such as "everyone except this user"
with the use of the ! negation prefix.

The rules for the filename paths are the same as for TCPAccessFiles settings.

completely (clients can stay connected for ever, without sending data). This 
is generally a bad idea as a hung tcp connection which is never 
properly disconnected (the remote network may have become disconnected from 
the Internet, etc) will cause a child server to never exit (at least not for 
a considerable period of time) until manually killed

Description
The TimeoutSession directive sets the maximum number of seconds a control
connection between the proftpd server and an FTP client can exist after the
client has successfully authenticated.  If the seconds argument is set to 0,
sessions are allowed to last indefinitely (the default).

The optional parameters are used to restrict the session time limit only
to specific users.  If "user" restriction is given, then expression is a
user-expression specifying to which users the time limit applies.  Similarly
for the "group" restriction.  For the "class" restriction, the expression is
simply the name of connection class for whom the time limit will apply.
Note that use of the "user" or "group" classifiers within an Anonymous
context will not make much sense.

unless overridden by a per-directory Umask setting. Any
arguments supplied must be an octal number, in the format 0xxx. An
optional second argument can specify a Umask to be used when creating
directories. If a second argument isn't specified, directories are created
using the default Umask in the first argument. For more information on
umasks, consult your operating system documentation/man pages.

Proftpd will not create files that have the execution bit turned
on, this is a security driven design decision.  The permissions of the
uploaded file can be changed by issuing a SITE CHMOD command can be
used to change the mode of the uploaded file.  Syntax of the command is:

Normally, incoming active mode data connections and outgoing passive mode 
data connections have a reverse DNS lookup performed on the remote host's 
IP address. In a chroot environment (such as Anonymous

checked and the only possible resolution is via DNS. If for some reason, DNS 
is not available or improperly configured this can result in proftpd blocking 
(stalling) until the libc resolver code times out. Disabling this 
directive prevents proftpd from attempting to reverse-lookup data connection 
IP addresses.

Compatibility

Description
The User directive configures which user the proftpd daemon will normally 
run as. By default, proftpd runs as root which is considered undesirable 
in all but the most trustful network configurations. The User directive used 
in conjunction with the Group directive 
instructs the daemon to switch to the specified user and group as quickly 
as possible after startup. On some unix variants, the daemon will occasionally 
switch back to root in order to accomplish a task which requires super-user 
access. Once the task is completed, root privileges are relinquished and the 
server continues to run as the specified user and group. When applied to a 
VirtualServer block, proftpd 
will run as the specified user/group on connections destined for the virtual 
server's address or port. If either User or Group 
is applied to an Anonymous 
block, proftpd will establish an anonymous login when a user attempts to login 
with the specified userid, as well as permanently switching to the corresponding 
uid/gid (matching the User/Group parameters found in the anonymous block) 
after login.
Note: When an authorized unix user is authenticated and logs in, all former 
privileges are released, the daemon switches permanently to the logged in 
user's uid/gid, and is never again capable of switching back to root or any 
other user/group.

Description
ProFTPD requires a real username/uid when authenticating users as
provided by PAM, AuthUserFile or another authentication mechanism.
There are however times when additional aliases are required but it is
undesirable to provide additional login accounts.

UserAlias provides a mechanism to do this, a typical and common
example is within Anonymous configuration blocks.  It is normal for the
server to use 'ftp' as the primary authentication user, however it is
common practice for users to login using "anonymous".  This is achieved
by adding the following to the config file.

Description
When set to true, the chroot base directory becomes a subdirectory of the 
anonymous ftp directory, based on the username of the current user.  For 
example, assuming user "foo" is aliased to "ftp", logging in as "foo" causes
proftpd to run as real user ftp, but to chroot into ~ftp/foo
instead of just ~ftp.

The UserPassword directive creates a password for a particular user which 
overrides the user's normal password in /etc/passwd (or /etc/shadow). The 
override is only effective inside the context to which UserPassword is applied. 
The hashed-password argument is a cleartext string 
which has been passed through the standard unix crypt() function. Do 
NOT use a cleartext password. This can be useful when combined with 
UserAlias to provide multiple logins to an Anonymous FTP site.

Module

Compatibility

Description
The VirtualHost configuration block is used to create an independent set 
of configuration directives that apply to a particular hostname or IP address. 
It is often used in conjunction with system level IP aliasing or dummy network 
interfaces in order to establish one or more virtual servers which 
all run on the same physical machine. The block is terminated with a /VirtualHost 
directive. By utilizing the 
Port directive inside a VirtualHost block, it is 
possible to create a virtual server which uses the same address as the master 
server, but listens on a separate tcp port (incompatible with ServerType inetd).
When proftpd starts, virtual server connections are handled in one of two 
ways, depending on the 
ServerType setting:
inetd
The daemon examines the destination address and port of the incoming connection 
handed off from inetd. If the connection matches one of the configured virtual 
hosts, the connection is serviced based on the appropriate configuration. 
If no virtual host matches, and the main server does not match, the client 
is informed that no server is available to service their requests and disconnected.
standalone
After parsing the configuration file, the daemon begins listening for connections 
on all configured ports, spawning child processes as necessary to handle 
connections for either the main server or any virtual servers.
Because of the method that the daemon uses to listen for connections when 
in standalone mode, it is possible to support an 
exceedingly large number of virtual servers, potentially exceeding the number 
of per-process file descriptors. This is due to the fact that a single file 
descriptor is used to listen to each configured port, regardless of the number 
of addresses being monitored. Note that it may be necessary to increase 
the
tcpBackLog value on heavily loaded 
servers in order to avoid kernel rejected client connections (Connection 
refused).

Module

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
The tcpBackLog directive controls the tcp backlog queue when 
listening for connections in standalone mode (see 
ServerType). It has no affect upon 
servers in inetd mode. When a tcp connection is 
established by the tcp/ip stack inside the kernel, there is a short period 
of time between the actual establishment of the connection and the acceptance 
of the connection by a user-space program. The duration of this latency period 
is widely variable, and can depend upon several factors (hardware, system 
load, etc). During this period tcp connections cannot be accepted, as the 
port that was previously listening has become filled with the 
new connection. Under heavy connection load this can result in occasional 
(or even frequent!) connection refused messages returned to the 
incoming client, even when there is a service available to handle requests. 
To eliminate this problem, most modern tcp/ip stacks implement a backlog 
queue which is simply a pre-allocation of resources necessary to handle 
backlog-size connections during the latency period. 
The larger the backlog queue, the more connections can be established in a 
very short time period. The trade-off, of course, is kernel memory and/or 
other kernel resources.
Generally it is not necessary to use a tcpBackLog directive, unless you intend 
to service a large number of virtual hosts (see VirtualHost), 
or have a consistently heavy system load. If you begin to notice or hear of 
connection refused messages from remote clients, try setting a 
slightly higher value to this directive.

Description
The tcpNoDelay directive controls the use of the TCP_NODELAY socket option 
(which disables the Nagle algorithm). ProFTPd uses TCP_NODELAY by default, 
which usually is a benefit but this can occasionally lead to problems with 
some clients, so tcpNoDelay is provided as a way to disable this option. You 
will not normally need to use this directive but if you have clients reporting 
unusually slow connections, try setting this to off.

Context

Module
 mod_core 

Compatibility
 0.99.0 and later 

Description
The tcpReceiveWindow directive configures the size (in octets) of all data 
connections' tcp receive windows. It is only used when receiving a file from 
a client over the data connection. Typically, a given tcp/ip implementation 
will use a relatively small receive window size (the number of octets that 
can be received at the tcp layer before a turnaround acknowledgement 
is required). When transferring a large amount of data over fast digital transmission 
lines which have a relatively high latency, a small receive window can dramatically 
affect perceived throughput because of the necessity to completely stop the 
transfer occasionally in order to wait for the remote endpoint to receive 
the acknowledgement and continue transmission. For example, on a T1 line (assuming 
full 1.544Mbps endpoint-to-endpoint throughput) with 100 ms latency, a 4k 
receive buffer will very dramatically reduce the perceived throughput. The 
default value of 8192 octets (8k) should be reasonable in common network configurations.
Additionally, proftpd allocates its internal buffers to match the receive/send 
window sizes; in order to maximize the reception/transmission performance 
(reducing the number of times data must be transfered from proftpd to the 
kernel tcp/ip stack). The tradeoff, of course, is memory; both kernel- and 
user-space. If running proftpd on a memory tight host (and on a low-bandwidth 
connection), it might be advisable to decrease both the tcpReceiveWindow and 
tcpSendWindow sizes.

RADIUS based authentication support

mod_radius

Description
This module provides RADIUS authentication and accounting support.

Strong authentication is in demand for Internet services. For many, this means using the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol.

However, there are caveats to using RADIUS for authentication. RADIUS packets are sent in the clear, which means that they can easily be sniffed. First, do not have your authenticating RADIUS servers exposed to the Internet; keep them protected within your LAN. Second, it is highly recommended to use separate RADIUS servers for each of your services.

RADIUS Authentication
The RADIUS protocol can be used for answering the question "Should this user be allowed to login?" However, the "yes/no" answer is not everything that proftpd needs to log a user in; the server also requires the UID and GID to use for the authenticated user, home directory, and shell. This information is usually not available from the RADIUS servers, which means that using RADIUS to provide all the necessary login information can be problematic. The RadiusUserInfo directive is meant to be used to address this issue, to provide the missing information.

In those cases where the RADIUS servers can provide that additional login information, via custom attributes, the RadiusUserInfo directive can also be used obtain that information as well.

RADIUS Accounting
While RADIUS is primarily used for authentication, the protocol also allows for accounting of user activities. The mod_radius module makes use of this ability, using RADIUS accounting packets to transmit the following data:

    * Acct-Authentic: How the user was authenticated (e.g. locally, or via RADIUS)
    * Acct-Session-Id: The process ID of the FTP session
    * Acct-Session-Time: The duration of the FTP session, in seconds
    * Acct-Input-Octets: The number of bytes uploaded (includes appending to files)
    * Acct-Output-Octets: The number of bytes downloaded
    Merely configuring a RadiusAcctServer enables the module's accounting capabilities.
    Common Attributes
    The following RADIUS attributes are sent with every RADIUS packet generated by mod_radius:
    * User-Name: The name of the logging-in user
    * NAS-Identifier: Always "ftp"
    * NAS-IP-Address: IP address of FTP server
    * NAS-Port: Port of FTP server
    * NAS-Port-Type: Always Virtual.
    * Calling-Station-Id: IP address of connecting FTP client

Interface to libwrap

mod_wrap

Description

 It enables the daemon to use the common tcpwrappers access control
library while in standalone mode, and in a very configurable manner.
It is not compiled by default. 

If not installed on your system, the TCP wrappers library,
required by this module, can be found here, on Wietse Venema's
site. Once installed, it highly recommended that the hosts_access(3)
and hosts_access(5) man pages be read and understood.

Many programs will automatically add entries in the common
allow/deny files, and use of this module will allow a ProFTPD daemon
running in standalone mode to adapt as these entries are added. The
portsentry program does this, for example: when illegal access is
attempted, it will add hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file.
