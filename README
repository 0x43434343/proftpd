ProFTPD 1.2 README
---------------------

INTRODUCTION
************


ProFTPD is a highly configurable ftp daemon for unix and unix-like
operating systems.  Currently, the following operating systems are
supported:

!! NOTE: gcc and gmake are _required_ on all platforms, unless otherwise
   indicated !!

Linux (recommend kernel 2.0.x or 2.2.x -- _glibc2 (libc6) required_)
BSDI 2.x (possibly)
BSDI 3.1 (tested -- use gmake instead of make)
BSDI 4.0
IRIX 6.2
IRIX 6.3 (native compiler or gcc)
IRIX 6.4 (tested) 
Solaris 2.5.1 (see README.Solaris2.5x)
Solaris 2.6
AIX 3.2 (native compiler)
AIX 4.2 (tested)
OpenBSD 2.2/2.3 (tested)
FreeBSD 2.2.7 (tested)
Digital UNIX 4.0A
DEC OFS/1 (native compiler)

  [ Note: there is a known problem with FreeBSD 2.2.7 and earlier
    involving libc.  Expect to see syslog/console messages similar
    to `cannot open /etc/pwd.db', as well as being unable to see
    user/group names inside of chroots ]

ProFTPD is designed to be somewhat of a "drop-in" replacement for wu-ftpd.
Full online documentation is available at http://www.proftpd.org,
including a server configuration directive reference manual.


INSTALLATION
************

For detailed installation instructions, see the INSTALL file in the source
distribution.

1.  Configure the source distribution for your OS type by running the GNU
autoconf 'configure' script in the root source directory.

2.  If configure runs without a problem, simply type 'make' from the root
source directory to build the necessary binaries.  You may need to tweak
config.h and/or Makefile to suit your needs.

3.  'make install' to install proftpd.  By default, the 'proftpd' binary
is installed into /usr/sbin.  You can alter the default installation
directories by editing the top level Makefile.

4.  By default, proftpd looks for a single configuration file as
/usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf.  Copy sample-configurations/basic.conf to
/usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf and modify to suit your needs.  More advanced
configuration examples are also included.

5.  If you wish to run proftpd as a standalone daemon, you'll need to
modify your system startup rc scripts to start proftpd on boot.  Make sure
you change the ServerType directive in /etc/proftpd.conf in order to tell
proftpd which mode it is running in.  If you wish to run proftpd from
inetd (the default), you'll need to modify your /etc/inetd.conf file
appropriately, and restart the inetd super-server.

6.  All done!
