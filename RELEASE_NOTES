                    1.3.8 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.8 release cycle, from the 1.3.8rc1 release to the 1.3.8 maintenance
releases.  More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and
ChangeLog files.

1.3.8rc1
---------

  + Fixed occasional segfaults with FTPS data transfers using TLSv1.3, when
    session tickets cannot be decrypted (Issue #1063).


  + Changed Directives

    RedisServer
      Redis 6.x changed its AUTH command, due to the Redis ACL system, for
      supporting multiple users.  Thus the `RedisServer` directive now takes
      a username, as well as a password.  The Redis server version is auto-
      detected; the configured username will be ignored for Redis servers
      older than Redis 6.x.
