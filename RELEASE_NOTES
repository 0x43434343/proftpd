                    1.3.0 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.0 release cycle, from the 1.3.0rc1 release to the 1.3.0-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.


1.3.0rc1
---------
  + New configuration directives:
      mod_sql now supports a SQLBackend configuration directive, for
      selecting the specific database backend module to use on a per-vhost
      basis.  Previously, mod_sql could only be compiled with one
      backend module at a time; the module has been enhanced to support
      multiple backend modules.  Since multiple backends are now
      possible, SQLBackend was added so that the administrator could
      specify which to use.  If only one backend module is used,
      e.g. mod_sql_mysql, then that backend is used by default, and
      no SQLBackend directive is required.

      MaxConnectionsPerHost
        Similar to MaxClientsPerHost, the administrator can configure
        the maximum number of connected clients from a single host at
        one time.  Unlike MaxClientsPerHost, though, the
        MaxConnectionsPerHost limit is evaluated prior to authentication,
        i.e. before the client has sent any USER and PASS commands.

      UseSendfile
        ProFTPD now automatically checks for sendfile support, and uses
        it if present.  The UseSendfile directive can be used to configure
        proftpd not to use the sendfile() function if necessary.

        Note that if sendfile support is enabled, tools like ftpwho and
        ftptop will not show the transfer rate for downloads.  These tools
        work by reading the scoreboard, and the scoreboard is updated
        periodically during uploads and downloads.  However, when
        sendfile() is used, scoreboard does not have a chance to be updated.
        This is only true for downloads; the tools will continue to
        show the transfer rate for uploads.

  + Enhanced configuration directives:
      ExtendedLog's new SEC logging class.  "sec" and "secure" will work.

  + New command-line options:
      The new -V, --settings display various compile-time settings.

  + New configure options:
      --enable-dso

  + New modules:
      mod_dso

  + New Display variables:

      %{total_bytes_in}
      %{total_bytes_out}
      %{total_bytes_xfer}
      %{total_files_in}
      %{total_files_out}
      %{total_files_xfer}

  + Deprecated configuration directives:
      Bind

        The Bind directive was causing too much confusion, and did not
        do as many system administrators assumed it.  Rather than using
        Bind to associate a server configuration with an IP address,
        administrators would assume it was meant for making ProFTPD
        bind to a single address.

        Rather than having a configuration like this:

          <VirtualHost host1.domain.com>
            Bind host2.domain.com
            ...
          </VirtualHost>

        The <VirtualHost> and DefaultAddress directives can now handle
        multiple address, so that the above configuration becomes:

          <VirtualHost host1.domain.com host2.domain.com>
            ...
          </VirtualHost>
