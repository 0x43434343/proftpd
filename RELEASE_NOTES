                    1.3.3 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.3 release cycle, from the 1.3.3rc1 release to the 1.3.3-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.

1.3.3rc1
---------

  + Added French, Bulgarian translations.

  + New command-line options:

    The -S, --serveraddr command-line option has been added.  This option
    can be used to specify the IP address of the host machine.  By
    default, proftpd attempts to resolve the host IP address by using DNS
    resolution of the hostname.  However, in cases where DNS is not
    configured for the host machine, this approach does not work.

    To specify the desired IP address, use -S when starting proftpd, e.g.:

      /usr/local/sbin/proftpd -S 1.2.3.4 ...

    And if you want proftpd to listen on all interfaces, you can specify
    a wildcard socket using an IP address of 0.0.0.0:

      /usr/local/sbin/proftpd -S 0.0.0.0 ...

  + New modules:

    mod_sftp

      This module implements the SSH2, SFTP, and SCP protocols.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html for more information.

    mod_sftp_pam

      This module uses PAM to provide a 'keyboard-interactive' SSH2
      authentication method for mod_sftp.  More information can be found in
      the documentation for mod_sftp_pam, in doc/contrib/mod_sftp_pam.html.

    mod_sftp_sql

      This module uses SQL (via mod_sql) for looking up authorized SSH2 
      public keys for user and hostbased authentication.  More information
      is available in doc/contrib/mod_sftp_sql.html.

  + New configuration directives:

    ScoreboardScrub

      The ScoreboardScrub directive can be used to turn on/off proftpd's
      periodic "scrubbing" of its ScoreboardFile, where the ScoreboardFile
      is scanned for entries of dead sessions:

        ScoreboardScrub on|off|secs

      Note that if scoreboard scrubbing is turned off, the ScoreboardFile
      can still be scrubbed on demand, either by using mod_ctrls_admin's
      "ftpdctl scoreboard scrub" action, or by using the new ftpscrub
      command-line utility.

    TLSPKCS12File

      The TLSPKCS12File directive of the mod_tls module is used to
      configure mod_tls to use the certificate and private key contained
      in the indicated PKCS#12 file.  Some sites already use PKCS#12 files
      for containing their other certificates, and thus find it useful to
      have PKCS#12 support in mod_tls.

  + Changed configuration directives:

    IdentLookups

      The default IdentLookups value is now 'off'.  The RFC1413 IDENT lookup
      adds latency to the login process, so much so that it is a FAQ to
      configure "IdentLookups off".  In addition, the IDENT protocol is not
      secure; it can easily be spoofed using man-in-the-middle attacks.  Sites
      that require IDENT lookups must now explicitly configure
      "IdentLookups on".

      Note that in order to use IdentLookups, you must compile proftpd with
      the mod_ident module.  If you use the --disable-ident configure
      option, then proftpd will not recognize the IdentLookups directive.
      Thus in your proftpd.conf, you should use something like:

        <IfModule mod_ident.c>
          IdentLookups on
        </IfModule>

      if you want to use RFC1413 lookups.


  + Deprecated configuration directives:

    AnonymousGroup

      Support for this directive has been removed.
