                  ------------------------

1.3.4rc1
---------

  + Fixed Telnet IAC stack overflow vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-925)
  + Fixed directory traversal bug in mod_site_misc (CVE-2010-3867)
  + Added Japanese translation
  + Many mod_sftp bugfixes
  + Fixed SSL_shutdown() errors caused by OpenSSL 0.9.8m and later
  + Fixed handling of utmp/utmpx format changes on FreeBSD
  + Automatic detection of MySQL, Postgres library and header file locations
  + Added support for SMTP authentication in ftpmail script
  + Updated fnmatch implementation, using glibc-2.9 version.

  + New modules:

    mod_copy

      This module provides the SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands, for
      allowing a client to copy files from one location to another on the
      server, without requiring downloads/uploads.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_copy.html for details.

    mod_deflate

      This module provides support for MODE Z, which uses compression to
      reduce the number of bytes required for data transfers and directory
      lists.  See doc/contrib/mod_deflate.html for more information.

      Depending on the data being transferred, clients can see quite
      a difference in the speed; see:

        http://www.smartftp.com/support/kb/file.php?f=192

      for some performance numbers.

    mod_ifversion

      This module allows for version-specific configuration sections of
      the proftpd config file.  It is useful for using the same proftpd
      config across multiple servers where different proftpd versions may
      be in use.  See doc/contrib/mod_ifversion.html for examples.

    mod_qos

      This module allows administrators to set networking-specific
      "Quality of Service" (QoS) bits on the packets used by the server.
      More information can be found in doc/contrib/mod_qos.html

  + New configuration directives:

    ScoreboardMutex
      Bug#3208

    SFTPClientAlive

  + Changed configuration directives:

    BanOnEvent

      The BanOnEvent directive of the mod_ban module now supports
      LoginRate events.

    ListOptions

      The mod_ls module now supports the -c and -u options for the LIST
      command.  The ListOptions directive handles these options as well.
      See the ls(1) man page for more details on these options.

      Another new ListOption, NoErrorIfAbsent (Bug#3506)

    LogFormat

      %I, %O variables

    SFTPOptions
      OldProtocolCompat (Bug#3480)

    TLSOptions
      CommonNameRequired (Bug#3512)

    UseSendfile
      Can now be used in <Directory> sections and .ftpaccess files.
      Can be used to specify lengths (in bytes) or percentages.
      See doc/howto/Sendfile.html for details.

  + Deprecated configuration directives:

    DisplayGoAway

      Support for this directive has been removed.
