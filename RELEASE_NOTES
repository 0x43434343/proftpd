                    1.2.11 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.2.11 release cycle, from the 1.2.11rc1 release to the 1.2.11-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.


1.2.11rc1
---------
  + New configuration directives:
      mod_sql now supports a SQLBackend configuration directive, for
      selecting the specific database backend module to use on a per-vhost
      basis.  Previously, mod_sql could only be compiled with one
      backend module at a time; the module has been enhanced to support
      multiple backend modules.  Since multiple backends are now
      possible, SQLBackend was added so that the administrator could
      specify which to use.  If only one backend module is used,
      e.g. mod_sql_mysql, then that backend is used by default, and
      no SQLBackend directive is required.

  + New command-line options:
      The new -V, --settings display various compile-time settings.
