                    1.3.0 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.0 release cycle, from the 1.3.0rc1 release to the 1.3.0-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.


1.3.0rc1
---------
  + New configuration directives:
      mod_sql now supports a SQLBackend configuration directive, for
      selecting the specific database backend module to use on a per-vhost
      basis.  Previously, mod_sql could only be compiled with one
      backend module at a time; the module has been enhanced to support
      multiple backend modules.  Since multiple backends are now
      possible, SQLBackend was added so that the administrator could
      specify which to use.  If only one backend module is used,
      e.g. mod_sql_mysql, then that backend is used by default, and
      no SQLBackend directive is required.

      MaxConnectionsPerHost
        Similar to MaxClientsPerHost, the administrator can configure
        the maximum number of connected clients from a single host at
        one time.  Unlike MaxClientsPerHost, though, the
        MaxConnectionsPerHost limit is evaluated prior to authentication,
        i.e. before the client has sent any USER and PASS commands.

  + New command-line options:
      The new -V, --settings display various compile-time settings.

  + New configure options:
      --enable-dso

  + New modules:
      mod_dso
