                    1.3.8 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.8 release cycle, from the 1.3.8rc1 release to the 1.3.8 maintenance
releases.  More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and
ChangeLog files.

1.3.8rc1
---------

  + Fixed occasional segfaults with FTPS data transfers using TLSv1.3, when
    session tickets cannot be decrypted (Issue #1063).

  + Fixed memory use-after-free issue in mod_sftp which can cause unexpected
    login/authentication issues.

  * Set the `OPENSSL_API_COMPAT` API version compatibility macro.  We currently
    set our OpenSSL API version to 1.0.0 and later; code which uses an OpenSSL
    API earlier than 1.0.0 will cause the build to fail.  Use the new
    `--disable-openssl-api-compat` configure option to disable use of this
    macro.


  + Changed Directives

    RedisServer
      Redis 6.x changed its AUTH command, due to the Redis ACL system, for
      supporting multiple users.  Thus the `RedisServer` directive now takes
      a username, as well as a password.  The Redis server version is auto-
      detected; the configured username will be ignored for Redis servers
      older than Redis 6.x.
