                    1.3.2 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.2 release cycle, from the 1.3.2rc1 release to the 1.3.2-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.

1.3.2rc1
---------

  + Added pkgconfig file

    As part of the process of installing proftpd from source, a proftpd.pc
    file, suitable for use by the common `pkg-config' tool, is provided.
    This proftpd.pc file is installed into the <install-dir>/lib/pkgconfig/
    directory.

    See http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/ for more details.

  + IPv6 support is enabled by default.  To disable at build time, use:

      ./configure --disable-ipv6 ...

    And to disable IPv6 support at runtime, use:

      UseIPv6 off

    in your proftpd.conf

  + Changed command-line behavior:

      The -vv command-line option currently shows only the static modules,
      e.g.:

        - ProFTPD Version: 1.3.0 (stable)
        -   Scoreboard Version: 01040002
        -   Built: mar gen 2 10:57:47 CET 2007
        -     Module: mod_core.c
        -     Module: mod_xfer.c
        -     Module: mod_auth_unix.c
        -     Module: mod_auth_file.c
        ...

      Now, the -vv command-line option will show all modules, static *and*
      shared:

        ProFTPD Version: 1.3.0 (stable)
        Scoreboard Version: 01040002
        Built: Thu Jun 14 14:13:37 UTC 2007

        Loaded modules:
          mod_ifsession.c
          mod_tls/2.1.1
          mod_cap/1.0
          ...

       Note that the output format has changed slightly (no leading " - ").
       The -l command-line option can be used to list just the static
       modules.

       Also note that order of the module listed via -vv shows the order
       in which the core proftpd engine calls each module, i.e. the modules
       are listed in module order.

  + New configuration directives:

      AuthPAMOptions

        "NoTTY"

      MaxTransferPerHost

      MaxTransfersPerUser

      TransferPriority

  + New contrib scripts:

      Added contrib/ftpmail, a Perl script which reads a TransferLog FIFO and
      sends automatic email notifications whenever uploads occur.  See
      doc/contrib/ftpmail.html for more details.

  + Enhanced configuration directives:

      BanOnEvent ClientConnectRate

        See doc/contrib/mod_ban.html#BanOnEvent

      LogFormat %f

        RNFR/RNTO, SITE CHGRP, SITE CHMOD

      TimeoutIdle, TimeoutNoTransfer, TimeoutStalled

        These directives can now be used within <Anonymous> sections to
        specify different timeouts for anonymous sessions.

      TLSOptions EnableDiags

        See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSOptions

      TLSRequired !data, ctrl+!data, auth+!data

        See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSRequired for more information.

  + Deprecated configuration directives

      AnonymousGroup

        This directive is NOT recommended, and relies on a "special
        dynamic configuration" which is very confusing to users.  It will
        be removed in the 1.3.3 ProFTPD release cycle.

  + New modules:

      mod_dynmasq

        Useful for sites using dynamic DNS and other similar services.
        This module automatically refreshes the IP address of the daemon,
        so that the correct address is communicated to clients i.e. via
        the MasqueradeAddress directive.  See the module documentation at:

          doc/contrib/mod_dynmasq.html

      mod_facts

        Implements the MLSD and MLST commands, as per RFC3659.  Also provides
        the MFF and MFMT commands from:

          http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-somers-ftp-mfxx-03.txt
 
        Module documentation is available for mod_facts at:

          doc/modules/mod_facts.html

      mod_ident

        The RFC1413 "identification protocol" lookup was separated out of
        the main proftpd code and into this mod_ident module.  With this
        change, you can now choose to build proftpd without this support
        using:

          ./configure --disable-ident ..

        You can also choose to build mod_ident as a shared module, loadable
        as needed:

          ./configure --enable-dso --with-shared=mod_ident ...

        Module documentation is available for mod_ident at:

          doc/modules/mod_ident.html

      mod_sql_odbc

        doc/contrib/mod_sql_odbc.html

      mod_sql_sqlite

        doc/contrib/mod_sql_sqlite.html

      mod_unique_id

        Generates a unique ID for every FTP session.  This ID can be
        written to log files and stored in databases, for tracking all of
        the activity associated with a particular FTP session.  See:

          doc/contrib/mod_unique_id.html

  + New documentation:

      doc/howto/ConfigurationTricks.html

  + Updated documentation:

      doc/howto/TLS.html

        Added instructions on how to use OpenSSL in FIPS mode.
