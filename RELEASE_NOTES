                    1.3.3 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.3 release cycle, from the 1.3.3rc1 release to the 1.3.3-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.

1.3.3rc1
---------

  + Added French, Bulgarian translations.

  + Changed configuration directives:

    IdentLookups

      The default IdentLookups value is now 'off'.  The RFC1413 IDENT lookup
      adds latency to the login process, so much so that it is a FAQ to
      configure "IdentLookups off".  In addition, the IDENT protocol is not
      secure; it can easily be spoofed using man-in-the-middle attacks.  Sites
      that require IDENT lookups must now explicitly configure
      "IdentLookups on".

      Note that in order to use IdentLookups, you must compile proftpd with
      the mod_ident module.  If you use the --disable-ident configure
      option, then proftpd will not recognize the IdentLookups directive.
      Thus in your proftpd.conf, you should use something like:

        <IfModule mod_ident.c>
          IdentLookups on
        </IfModule>

      if you want to use RFC1413 lookups.


  + Deprecated configuration directives:

    AnonymousGroup

      Support for this directive has been removed.
