xferstats.holger-preiss (BSD license, I think)

	A port of the infamous wu-ftpd xferlog perl analysis script,
	w/ bug fixes and some modifications.  Useful for analyzing
	your /var/log/xferlog files.  See xferlog(5).

mod_ratio.c (GPL license)

	A 3rd party module (distributed w/ the debian proftpd package)
	which implements file/byte ratios in proftpd.  To install,
	run:

		./configure --with-modules=mod_ratio

	From the top-level source directory.  See the comments
	at the top of mod_ratio.c for add'l directives and usage.

mod_linuxprivs.c (GPL license)

	This module takes advantage of current Linux development kernel's
	(2.1.x) POSIX.1e security model enhancements (consisting of
	capabilities and capability sets at the moment).  Use of this
	module _greatly_ enhances security (for one thing, it makes
	escaping from a chroot'd jail next to _impossible_).  This
	module requires Linux kernel version 2.1.104 or newer.
	A modified version of the libcap library is included (see below)
	and automagically built when you include this module in your
	proftpd build.  Tested under Linux 2.1.122.  To build simply:

	./configure --with-modules=mod_linuxprivs

	For detailed information see README.linux-privs

libcap (Unknown license, probably GPL)

	This library provides the interface between mod_linuxprivs
	(above) and the capability syscalls in Linux 2.1.  YOU DO
	NOT NEED TO BUILD THIS LIBRARY.  If you include mod_linuxprivs
	in your proftpd build, running 'make' from the top-level directory
	will automatically build libcap and link it in.
